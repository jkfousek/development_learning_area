          <h2>Timeline</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He showed a prodigious talent for mathematics and physics from an early age. In 1875, he moved to Graz, Austria, to study at the Polytechnic Institute. After completing his studies in 1878, Tesla traveled extensively before settling in the United States in 1884.</li>

            <li>Tesla worked with inventor Thomas Edison for a short time but soon parted ways due to disagreements over the development of alternating current (AC) electricity technology. In 1887, Tesla established his own laboratory in New York City, where he continued to develop and improve AC electrical systems.</li>

            <li>Tesla's inventions and experiments during this time included the induction motor, wireless energy transmission, high-frequency electrical systems, and the invention of neon lighting. He also conducted numerous experiments on X-rays and was granted a patent for his X-ray apparatus in 1901.</li>

            <li>Tesla's fame grew, and he received invitations to speak at various scientific conferences. However, he struggled with finances throughout his life due to his lavish lifestyle and lack of proper management of his inventions. His greatest financial success came from the patents for his polyphase AC system, which he sold to George Westinghouse in 1891.</li>

            <li>Despite his financial struggles, Tesla continued to conduct experiments on remote control, robotics, and even attempted to build a wireless transmission tower for world-wide communication. However, these projects were abandoned due to lack of funding.</li>

            <li>Nikola Tesla passed away on January 7, 1943, at the age of 86 in his New York City hotel room. He was interred in the Tesla Memorial Society plot at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. Throughout his life, Tesla remained a reclusive figure but left an indelible mark on the world of electrical engineering and technology.</li>
