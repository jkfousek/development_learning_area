# Block-level Content
In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called block-level content.

In a block layout, boxes are laid out one after another, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block.
A block-level element always starts on a new line. In horizontal writing modes, like english or Arabic, it occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container) and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".

# Inline-level Content
In CSS, content that participates in inline layout is called inline-level content. Most text sequences, replaced elements, and generated content are inline-level by default.

In inline layout, a mixed stream of text, replacedc elements, and other inline boxes are laid out by fragmenting them into a stack of line boxes. Within each line box, inline-level boxes are aligned to each other vertically or horizontally, depending on the writing mode. Typically, they are aligned by the baseline of their text. This can be changed with CSS.
